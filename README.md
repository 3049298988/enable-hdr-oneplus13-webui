# Enable HDR on OnePlus 13 with WebUI

What's it?

By default, only a few apps on OnePlus 13 can enable HDR.
This module extends the whitelist, allowing more apps to enable HDR and Dolby Vision
.
It now also includes a built-in WebUI so you can easily manage which apps are enabled without editing XML manually.

App list

- Preconfigured popular apps (Netflix, YouTube, Prime Video, Disney+, etc.)

- You can also add/remove apps yourself via the WebUI.

WebUI
